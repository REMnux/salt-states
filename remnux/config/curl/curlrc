## Sample Curl initialization file .wgetrc optimizied for

## You may need to modify the file to spoof specific browsers,
## referrers, and other conditions.
##
## You may also need to add a header to specify the virtual
## host on a multi-site server, such as:
##
##   header = Host: www.somehost.com
## 
## ... or on the command-line to wget, such as:
##
##   --header="Host: www.somehost.com"
##

# Modern browsers tend to set these
header = "Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, image/pjpeg, application/x-shockwave-flash, application/x-ms-application, application/x-ms-xbap, application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument, application/xaml+xml, */*"

header = "Accept-Language: en-us"
# This one should be on for realism, but it makes it a bit more painful to view the results
# header = "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"

# Modern browsers tend to set these
header = "Connection: Keep-Alive"

# Taken from http://useragentstring.com/index.php?id=19813
user-agent = "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible, MSIE 11, Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0;  rv:11.0) like Gecko"

# Requests from HTTPS sites no longer include this header, so disable it by default
